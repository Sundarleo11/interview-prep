## âœ… Questions & Answers

### 1. Difference between Element and Component
- **Element** â†’ Plain object describing what to render (immutable).  
- **Component** â†’ Function/class that returns an element.  

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello</h1>; // Element
function Welcome() { return <h1>Hello</h1>; } // Component
```

---

### 2. What are Pure Components?
- `React.PureComponent` does a **shallow comparison of props & state** to avoid unnecessary re-renders.  
- Equivalent for functional components â†’ `React.memo`.

---

### 3. What are Refs in React?
- Refs provide a way to **directly access DOM nodes or React elements**.  

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef} />
```

---

### 4. What is forwardRef?
- Technique to **pass refs through a component** to its child.  

```jsx
const Child = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => <input ref={ref} />);
```

---

### 5. What is the Virtual DOM?
- **Virtual DOM** â†’ lightweight in-memory representation of real DOM.  
- React updates Virtual DOM, then diffs & patches changes to the real DOM.

---

### 6. What are interceptors (HTTP requests)?
- Not part of React itself, but in **Axios/Fetch wrappers**.  
- Interceptors allow **modifying requests/responses globally** (e.g., attach tokens).

---

### 7. What is React Fiber?
- **React Fiber** = reconciliation algorithm introduced in React 16.  
- Supports incremental rendering (splitting rendering into chunks).

---

### 8. Lifecycle Methods (Class vs Functional)

**Class Components**
- Mount â†’ `constructor`, `componentDidMount`  
- Update â†’ `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`  
- Unmount â†’ `componentWillUnmount`

**Functional Components**
- `useEffect` replaces multiple lifecycle methods.

---

### 9. When do we use Higher Order Components (HOC)?
- HOC = function that takes a component and returns a new one.  
- Use cases: reusability, logging, authentication.

---

### 10. What is Lazy Loading in React?
- **Load components on demand** to reduce bundle size.  

```jsx
const LazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComp'));
```

---

### 11. Role-Based Nested Routing
- Use `react-router-dom` with **protected routes**.  

```jsx
<Route path="/admin" element={role==="admin" ? <Admin /> : <NoAccess />} />
```

---

### 12. What is the Latest React Framework?
- **Next.js** â†’ server-side rendering + static site generation.  
- Others: Remix, Gatsby.

---

### 13. What is Event Delegation in React?
- React uses **synthetic events** with delegation at the root for performance.

---

### 14. Types of Events in React
- Mouse Events (`onClick`)  
- Keyboard Events (`onKeyDown`)  
- Form Events (`onChange`)  
- Touch Events (`onTouchStart`)  

---

### 15. Event Capturing vs Bubbling
- **Capturing**: Event flows **root â†’ target**.  
- **Bubbling**: Event flows **target â†’ root**.  
- React supports both (`onClick`, `onClickCapture`).

---

### 16. What is React.memo?
- Memoizes functional components to **avoid re-render** if props didnâ€™t change.  

```jsx
export default React.memo(MyComp);
```

---

### 17. Optimization Techniques
- Code splitting â†’ `React.lazy`, dynamic imports  
- Memoization â†’ `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`  
- Pure components to reduce re-renders  
- Tree shaking to remove unused code

---

### 18. What is Tree Shaking?
- Dead code elimination by bundlers (Webpack/Rollup).  
- Removes unused imports/functions.

---

### 19. Debounce in React

```jsx
function useDebounce(fn, delay) {
  const timeout = useRef();
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeout.current);
    timeout.current = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}
```

---

### 20. Lifecycle of React Components
- **Mount â†’ Update â†’ Unmount**  
- In functional components â†’ handled via `useEffect`.

---

### 21. useMemo Use Case
- Avoids recalculating expensive operations unless dependencies change.  

```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => compute(num), [num]);
```

---

### 22. What is React? Benefits?
- **React** = JavaScript library for building UI.  
- **Benefits**: Reusability, Virtual DOM performance, ecosystem.  
- **Bundling benefit**: Smaller files + fewer network requests.

---

### 23. Puppeteer Fallback in React
- **Puppeteer** = Headless Chrome for rendering/testing.  
- Fallback for SSR â†’ if JS fails, Puppeteer can render static HTML snapshots.
