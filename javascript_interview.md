## âœ… JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1. What is Hoisting in JavaScript?
**A:** Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope (global or function scope) during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

Important: Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations

---

### Q2. Difference between Rest and Spread operators?
**A:** Rest (`...`) collects multiple arguments into an array. Spread (`...`) expands elements of an array/object.

Rest Operator (...) Used in:

Function parameters
Destructuring
Example:
```
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10

Here, ...numbers collects all arguments into an array.
```


Spread Used in:

Array/Object cloning
Merging
Passing arguments

```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];

console.log(arr2); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Here, ...arr1 spreads the elements of arr1 into arr2.
```

| Feature       | Rest (`...`)                          | Spread (`...`)                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**   | Collects multiple values into one      | Expands values from an iterable or object   |
| **Used in**   | Function parameters, destructuring     | Arrays, objects, function calls             |
| **Example**   | `function fn(...args)`                | `[...array]` or `{...object}`              |


---

### Q3. Difference between slice and splice?
**A:** `slice` returns a shallow copy without modifying the array. `splice` modifies the array by adding/removing elements.

| Feature         | `slice()`                                      | `splice()`                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Extracts a portion of an array                 | Adds/removes/replaces elements in an array      |
| **Return Value**| Returns a new array                            | Returns the removed elements                    |
| **Original Array** | Unchanged (non-mutating)                   | Changed (mutating)                              |
| **Use Case**    | When you want to copy or extract data         | When you want to update the array               |

```
slice() Example
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
const sliced = fruits.slice(1, 3); // ['banana', 'cherry']
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'] â€” original unchanged


splice() Example

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
const removed = fruits.splice(1, 2, 'blueberry', 'kiwi');
// removes 'banana' and 'cherry', inserts 'blueberry' and 'kiwi'
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'blueberry', 'kiwi', 'date']
console.log(removed); // ['banana', 'cherry']


```

### Q4. What is Destructuring?
**A:** Destructuring allows extracting values from arrays or objects into separate variables.

---

### Q5. What is a Closure?
**A:** A closure is created when a function remembers its outer scope even after it has executed.

---

### Q6. Explain the Event Loop in JavaScript.
**A:** The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking async operations by managing the call stack and task queues.

---

### Q7. What are Promises?
**A:** Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

---

### Q8. What is Async/Await?
**A:** `async` declares an asynchronous function returning a Promise. `await` pauses until the Promise resolves.

---

### Q9. Difference between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions?
**A:** Regular functions have their own `this`, can be constructors, and have `arguments`. Arrow functions have lexical `this`, no `arguments`, and canâ€™t be constructors.

---

### Q10. What are ES6 Classes?
**A:** ES6 classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes to create objects and enable inheritance.

---

### Q11. Explain Prototype-based inheritance.
**A:** Objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype object.

---

### Q12. Arrow Functions and benefits?
**A:** Provide concise syntax and lexical `this` binding.

---

### Q13. What are Template Literals?
**A:** Strings using backticks (`` ` ``) with embedded expressions.

---

### Q14. What are Default Parameters?
**A:** Function parameters with default values if not provided.

---

### Q15. Explain map, filter, and reduce.
**A:** 
- `map`: transforms each element.  
- `filter`: selects elements.  
- `reduce`: accumulates values.

---

### Q16. What is Currying?
**A:** Converting a function with multiple args into a series of functions with one arg each.

---

### Q17. Explain Debouncing and Throttling.
**A:** Debounce delays execution until after pause. Throttle limits execution to once per interval.

---

### Q18. What are call, apply, and bind?
**A:** 
- `call`: invoke with `this` and arguments.  
- `apply`: invoke with `this` and array args.  
- `bind`: returns new function with bound `this`.

---

### Q19. Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy?
**A:** Shallow copy copies first level only. Deep copy duplicates nested objects.

---

### Q20. Difference between for, for...in, and for...of?
**A:** 
- `for`: index-based iteration.  
- `for...in`: iterates object keys.  
- `for...of`: iterates iterable values.

---

### Q21. What are Modules in JavaScript?
**A:** ES Modules split code into files using `import` and `export`.

---

### Q22. Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing?
**A:** 
- `?.` safely accesses properties.  
- `??` provides default for `null` or `undefined`.

---

### Q23. Memory Management & Garbage Collection?
**A:** Automatic via garbage collector (Mark-and-Sweep). Unreachable objects are cleared.

---

### Q24. Difference between let, const, and var?
**A:** 
- `var`: function-scoped, hoisted.  
- `let`: block-scoped, not redeclared.  
- `const`: block-scoped, not reassigned.

---

### Q25. const with primitive vs non-primitive?
**A:** 
- Primitive: value cannot change.  
- Objects: reference fixed but properties mutable.

---

### Q26. Shallow copy vs Deep copy?
**A:** Shallow copies share references to nested objects. Deep copies duplicate all.

---

### Q27. Difference between map and filter?
**A:** 
- `map`: transforms each element.  
- `filter`: returns elements passing a test.

---

### Q28. What is a prototype?
**A:** Every object has a prototype for inheritance.

---

### Q29. Arrow functions and advantages?
**A:** Shorter syntax, lexical `this`, not for constructors.

---

### Q30. When to use bind, call, and apply?
**A:** Use them to set `this` explicitly.

---

### Q31. Spread vs Rest?
**A:** Spread expands, Rest collects.

---

### Q32. What is event delegation?
**A:** Single parent handles events for multiple children.

---

### Q33. Types of events?
**A:** UI, mouse, keyboard, focus, form events.

---

### Q34. Event capturing vs bubbling?
**A:** 
- Capturing: parent â†’ child.  
- Bubbling: child â†’ parent.

---

### Q35. JavaScript object methods?
**A:** `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`, `Object.assign()`, `Object.freeze()`, `Object.seal()`.

---

### Q36. Object.seal vs Object.freeze?
**A:** 
- `seal`: prevents add/remove, allows modify.  
- `freeze`: prevents add/remove/modify.

---

### Q37. Can const object values change?
**A:** Object properties mutable; primitive const values fixed.

---

### Q38. What is the Event Loop?
**A:** Mechanism for async handling, checking call stack and queues.

---

### Q39. Microtasks vs Macrotasks?
**A:** 
- Microtasks: Promises, MutationObservers.  
- Macrotasks: setTimeout, setInterval, I/O.

---

### Q40. Example of Debounce?
```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```
